# Contributor Rituals

These rituals formalize how contributors are welcomed, rewarded, and elevated.

1. The Initiation (Onboarding)
   - Complete `init-001` First Offering.
   - Outcome: `Initiate` badge and XP.
   - Symbolic step: contributor signs the Oath of Crafting (off-chain link stored in profile).

2. The Opening of the Codex (Contribution)
   - Submit a PR with meaningful change (code, doc, art).
   - Ritual: a peer reviewer invokes "blessing" by approving the PR.
   - Reward: `Scribe` or `Wayfinder` badge based on impact.

3. The Elevation (Sustained Impact)
   - Accumulate milestones (issues closed, community events, code merged).
   - Governance: become eligible for Moderator role and access to ritual admin tools.

Recordkeeping
- Every ritual occurrence should be logged on-chain when it affects token state.
- Off-chain proofs (meeting attendance, publication links) are submitted to a verification oracle or steward for manual attestations.

Tone
- Rituals are aspirational, inclusive, and transparent. They are designed as a scaffold for community rites.
