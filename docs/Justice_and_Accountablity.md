# Justice and Accountability

Justice is a process; accountability is the ledger.

Model
- Restorative First: prefer restoration for low-severity harms (restitution, apologies).
- Proportional Punishment: penalties scale with severity and recurrence.
- Transparent Tribunal: the Circle of Judgment logs votes and outcomes for public audit.

Implementation
- Record incidents as events.
- Recommend community tribunal for anything above threshold severity.
- Allow appeal: a mechanism to reopen tribunal records if new evidence emerges.

Procedures
- Friendly-fire incidents trigger evaluateFriendlyFire logic (off-chain) and may escalate.
- Penalties may be applied to reputation, guild privileges, or require token restitution.

Ethos
- Protect the vulnerable, rehabilitate when possible, and deter harmful systemic patterns.
