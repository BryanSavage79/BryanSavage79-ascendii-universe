# BondingCurveToken

A self-regulating token with a built-in automated market maker based on a bonding curve.

## 📖 Overview
This contract implements a **continuous liquidity** and **dynamic pricing** mechanism using a mathematical bonding curve.

- **Buy tokens** → price increases as supply grows  
- **Sell tokens** → price decreases as supply shrinks  
- **Reserve pool** maintains liquidity at all times  

## ⚙️ Core Features
- Deterministic pricing model (quadratic by default)
- No external liquidity needed
- Fully on-chain price discovery
- OpenZeppelin-based ERC20 security

| `sell(uint256 amount)` | Burns tokens and refunds ETH |
| `calculateBuyCost(uint256)` | Returns ETH required for given mint |
