Value = Base × Rarity × Quality × (1 + Attributes) × (1 + Sales) 

This formula mimics natural market growth:
- Scarcity (rarity)
- Craftsmanship (quality)
- Uniqueness (attributes)
- Reputation (sales)

## Gameplay & Economics

### Crafting
To mint (craft) an NFT:
1. Spend `componentCost` in ERC20 tokens.
2. Tokens are burned, ensuring scarcity.
3. A new NFT is minted with randomized quality and chosen attributes.

### Selling
Trusted marketplaces can call `recordSale(tokenId)` to increase its `sellCount`, which in turn **boosts its computed value**.

## Philosophy
> “Creation is not a one-time act. It’s a living process.”

The Ascendii Universe represents a new economic model where value grows through harmony — between creator, creation, and the collective consciousness of participants.

This PoC is the **first working demonstration** of that model in smart contract form.
